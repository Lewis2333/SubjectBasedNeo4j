## Currently implemented functions:
① Read three columns of data from CSV and remove empty data (including unit chapter section)

## Possible future functionalities:
① Front end self drawn knowledge graph

② Compatible with more data format files

Tips:  At present, it is limited to CSV three column data, and the testing materials need to be obtained by writing crawler code on their own.

The figure below is based on a large number of data tests.
